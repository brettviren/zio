    /*!
      @brief An identified vertex in a ported, directed graph

      Each port (a @ref zio::Port) is named uniquely within the node
      and has a ZeroMQ socket which may (simultaneously) bind and
      connect.

      Every bind is advertised for discovery by a @ref zio::Peer.

      Each connect may be direct which completes immediately or
      indirect (given based on node/port names) which waits for peer
      discovery to resolve.

      Nodes start in "offline" state.  During that state, ports may be
      created.  The ports also start in "offline" state and while offline
      they may bind() or connect().  When a node is brought "online" it
      brings all ports "online" and it is then when any bind() or
      connect() and associated discovery are performed.  A node and its
      ports may be taken subsequently "offline" and the cycle repeated.
