        Parameters
        ----------
        server : zio.Port
            An online SERVER port
        factory : callable
            See below
        
        This broker routes messages between a pair of clients: a
        remote client and its handler.  It does this by adding a flow
        initiation protocol to ZIO flow protocol.

        On receipt of a BOT, the broker passes it to the factory which
        should return True if the BOT was accepted.  The factory call
        should return as promptly as possible as the broker blocks on
        this call.

        If factory returns True then it is expected that the factory
        has started some other client which contacs the broker with
        the BOT.  The factory or the new client may modify the BOT as
        per flow protocol but must leave intact the `cid` attribute
        placed in the flow object by the broker.

        Note that the flow handler protocol does not communicate the
        location of the broker's SERVER socket.  It is up to handler
        implementations to locate the the server.

        After this flow initiating prototocl messages between client
        and handler are merely passed through the broker.
