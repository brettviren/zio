    The ruleset factory will apply each rule in the set and used the
    first one that evaluates True.  This will govern the parameters
    for the file resource.

    The file resource is delegated to a pair of actor functions for
    reading and another for writing.  A single reader/writer actor is
    launched to handle each new file and a reader or writer handler is
    used to handle each new client.

        Parameters
        ----------

        ctx : a zmq.Context

        ruleset: array of dictionary

            A ruleset is a sequence of rule specifications (see Rule
            Attributes below).

        wactors : 2-tuple of 2-tuples specifing file writing actors 

            See below.

        ractor : 2-tuple specifying file reading actors and any args

            See below

        The "*actors" args are 2-tuples specifying actor functions and
        optional user data arguments for writing and reading.

        The head of the 2-tuple is for the file actor which directly
        manages some file resource.  The tail is for the client actor
        which will connect to the file actor socket (and presumably
        some other socket).  If either element of this 2-tuple is
        itself a tuple then the head is treated as the actor function
        and any remainder is passed to the function as user data
        arguments.

        A file actor is called as:

            file_handler(ctx, pipe, 
                         filename,
                         *user_data):

        The file actor function must adhere to a simple protocol on
        its actor pipe.  After issuing the usual actor ready signal
        and before entering its loop, the file actor shall return on
        its actor pipe as a string the address of a bound socket to
        which any subsequent client actors may connect.

        A client actor is called as:

            client_handler(ctx, pipe, 
                           bot, rule_object, file_addr, 
                           *user_data)

        The client actor has no protocol on its actor pipe other than
        the usual ready signal.

        Rule Attributes
        ---------------

        rule : string

            An S-expression in terms of attributes evaluating to a
            Boolean.  First rule returning True is used.  Here and
            below "attributes" refer to the combination of BOT message
            header values and any additional specified in the `attr`
            Rule Attribute (described below).

        rw : string 

            Takes value "read" or "write" and determines if the flow
            is to be read from or written to file.

        filepat : f-string

            An f-string formatted against the attributes which
            resolves to the name of the file to be read or written.

        grouppat : f-string

            An f-string formatted against attributes to determine and
            to add a "hdfgroup" parameter to the BOT message prior to
            it being sent into a read or write handler.  The value
            will be used to define an HDF base group path into which
            messages from one stream will be mapped.  This path must
            be unique to the flow client.

        attr : dictionary
        
            An optional, extra dictionary of attributes updated on the
            dictionary of message attributes prior to applying to the
            rule or either patterns.
