#+title: Flow Broker
#+setupfile: setup.org

The simple flow server described in [[file:flow.org][flow]] will break if more than one
client attempts to enter the conversation.  That document also
describes how to use multiple ~zio::flow::Flow~ instances to handle
per-client transmissions.  The application is of course free to define
the handling mechanism and this document describes one possible
solution which is here called a /flow broker/.

* Architecture
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: architecture
  :END:

The /flow broker/ associates a remote client with a local client
handler.  The association is via the /routing ID/ number which is
carried by any message received from a SERVER socket held by the
broker.  Likewise, for a message to be delivered to a client it must
have had a /routing ID/ set on it by the broker applications.

The broker thus can not associate these two clients until each try to
send to each other.  But, they can not send to each other until the
broker associates them.  This catch-22 is broken in the flow broker's
/flow initiation protocol/ which is a small extension to the basic /flow
protocol/ and is not exposed to remote clients.

The flow initiation (FI) protocol is illustrated in the following UML
sequence diagram.



[[file:flow-broker.png]]


In the diagram the object named *client* is the remote client, the *port*
represents the *broker* ZIO port with a SERVER socket.  The FI protocol
is inserted between the reception of the *BOT* message from the remote
client (*BOT-rem) and its reply (*BOT-loc*) from the local client handler
and proceeds through this sequence:

1. *broker* receives *BOT-rem* and stores the ZeroMQ /routing ID/ of that
   message into a ~cid~ attribute of the ZIO message flow object (prefix
   header label attribute) and reverses the value of the flow
   ~direction~ attribute producing the *BOT-loc* message.  It then calls
   the *factory* on this message.
2. *factory* dispatches the message in an application-dependent manner.
   Shown here, a *handler* is spawned.  Other dispatching patterns are
   allowed, but the subsequent behavior of the *handler* illustrates
   what is required those patterns by the FI protocol.
3. *handler* sends to *port* the *BOT-loc* message, typically as-is but may
   make changes if the application level protocol requires it however
   it must keep the ~cid~ flow object attribute intact.
4. On receipt of any message with a ~cid~ attribute the *broker* records
   the /routing ID/ of that message and the ~cid~ in that message in a
   bidirectional association.
5. The *broker* strips the ~cid~, forwards *BOT-loc* to the remote client,
   reverses its ~direction~ attribute and sends it to the local client
   handler thus completing the flow protocol *BOT* handling for both
   clients.
6. Subsequent flow messages from either remote client or local client
   handler can now be routed to its partner.
7. Any *EOT* flow message observed by the *broker* will result in removal
   of the corresponding entry in the bidirectional association.  Any
   non-*BOT* messages with a /routing ID/ not present in this association
   are dropped.

* Addressing
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: addressing
  :END:


The creation of the *broker* SERVER *port* is outside the scope of the FI
protocol extension.  That is, the application must arrange for the
*port* to be online prior to *broker* operation and any *factory* and
*handlers* must know how to form attachment (be it connect or bind)
between their sockets and that of the *port*.  It is not required, but
this attachment mechanism may be simplified by requiring the *port*
socket to bind and any clients to connect.

* Broker Complexity
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: complexity
  :END:

The complexity of the broker appears somewhat high while one might say
it does not actually "do" anything.  However, the broker is absorbing
complexity that may otherwise have to be expressed elsewhere.  This
section outlines what this means.

** Broker as mirror
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: mirror
   :END:

The *broker* and its given *factor* provides a mirror that allows remote
clients and local client handlers to be implemented with a high degree
of symmetry.  A class providing the remote client may be used as-is in
a local client handler depending on the design of the
application-provided *factory*.  That is, if both *client* and *handler* are
designed to take their initial *BOT* they may be implemented
identically.

** Handler simplicity
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: simplicity
   :END:

Because a handler may be implemented in terms of a client it may use
the ~zio::flow::Flow~ C++ API (see [[file:flow.org][flow]]) or ~zio.flow.Flow~ object in
Python.  Without the extra SERVER socket and its added complexity a
new protocol would need to be invented to implement client handlers.

** Centralization
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: central
   :END:

Brokers are naturally centralizing.  This can be advantageous or
problematic.  Without a broker, a developer may instead create one
simple flow server (as described in [[file:flow.org][flow]]) for each remote client to
converse.  The software operator must then know to configure and
execute one such simple client per each remote.  ZIO [[file:peer.org][peering]] can help
ameliorate bringing together these pairs, but any execute-on-demand
pattern would need to be invented by the developer.  The *factory*
provides that pattern here.

The centralization also helps when the resource managed is shared
between the local client handlers.  For example, if multiple handlers
write to a common file some mechanism is likely required to assure
this writing is thread safe.  Such a mechanism is more naturally
created if the handlers all reside in a common executable.

The centralization does mean an aggregation of flows into one socket
and this alone may pose a bottleneck on bandwidth grounds.  

* Handler Synchronicity
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: lockstep
  :END:

The *broker* manages its *port* in a single thread and while the operation
in that thread is very simple, it will only service one message at a
time.  In particular, the *broker* relies on the call on the *factory* to
return promptly.  The *factory* must not be designed to directly handle
the FI protocol or else deadlock is assured.

Depending on the nature of the *factory* dispatch method, handlers will
typically operate asynchronously from each other. Depending on the
application, some handler synchronization may be required.  For
example, a *broker* may be created with a *factory* producing *handlers* for
the purpose of writing ZIO message data to a file.  Typically,
multiple writes must be performed synchronously.

The *handlers* could of course assert a mutex to assure this
synchronization.  Another pattern which leverages message passing can
be used.  The handlers may merely forward their messages to a single
entity that manages a file resource.  They might use PUSH sockets and
thus the PULL socket of the file service will provide the required
synchronization.

This arrangement is illustrated in the following connection diagram.
